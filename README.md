A simple nice to do app in plain TypeScript.

## Coming next
- Styles
- Tests
- More features: date picker, color picker, owner, progress, report panel, serverless API, and more.

## Project setup
This project is using yarn.

Install
```
yarn
```

We running this app locally you need to run two terminal windows:
One to compile TypeScript on the go:
```
yarn compile
```
And another to run the live dev server:
```
yarn start
```

Run tests (coming)
```
yarn test
```

Build app for production (not ready)
```
yarn build
```
